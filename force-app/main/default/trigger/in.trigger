 an example of a Salesforce trigger code that could be used to implement the Loan Applicant Credit Check and Pre-Qualification Report Generation System user story:

```
trigger LoanApplicantCreditCheck on Loan_Applicant__c (after insert, after update) {
    // Retrieve the loan applicant records that triggered the event
    List<Loan_Applicant__c> loanApplicants = [SELECT Id, Name, Credit_Score__c, Income__c, Debts__c, Previous_Loan_Repayments__c
                                              FROM Loan_Applicant__c
                                              WHERE Id IN :Trigger.new];
    
    // Perform credit check and pre-qualification report generation for each loan applicant
    for (Loan_Applicant__c applicant : loanApplicants) {
        // Retrieve credit score from a reliable source
        Integer creditScore = CreditScoreService.getCreditScore(applicant.Name);
        
        // Evaluate financial history
        Boolean hasGoodFinancialHistory = FinancialHistoryService.evaluateFinancialHistory(applicant.Income__c, applicant.Debts__c, applicant.Previous_Loan_Repayments__c);
        
        // Assess creditworthiness based on credit score and financial history
        Boolean isCreditworthy = CreditWorthinessService.assessCreditworthiness(creditScore, hasGoodFinancialHistory);
        
        // Generate credit check and pre-qualification report
        String report = ReportGenerationService.generateReport(applicant.Name, creditScore, hasGoodFinancialHistory, isCreditworthy);
        
        // Update loan applicant record with credit check report
        applicant.Credit_Check_Report__c = report;
    }
    
    // Update loan applicant records
    update loanApplicants;
}
