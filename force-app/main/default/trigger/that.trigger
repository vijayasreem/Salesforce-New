Here is an example of a Salesforce trigger code that can be used to implement the credit check and pre-qualification process for loan applicants:

trigger LoanApplicationTrigger on Loan_Application__c (before insert, before update) {
    // Loop through all the loan applications
    for (Loan_Application__c loanApp : Trigger.new) {
        // Perform credit check process
        Credit_Check__c creditCheck = new Credit_Check__c();
        creditCheck.Applicant__c = loanApp.Applicant__c;
        creditCheck.Credit_Score__c = loanApp.Credit_Score__c;
        creditCheck.Financial_History__c = loanApp.Financial_History__c;
        creditCheck.evaluateCreditworthiness();
        
        // Determine loan amount and interest rate range for pre-qualification
        if (creditCheck.Credit_Score__c >= 700 && creditCheck.Financial_History__c == 'Good') {
            loanApp.Loan_Amount__c = 100000;
            loanApp.Interest_Rate__c = '1.5% - 2.0%';
        } else if (creditCheck.Credit_Score__c >= 600 && creditCheck.Financial_History__c == 'Fair') {
            loanApp.Loan_Amount__c = 50000;
            loanApp.Interest_Rate__c = '2.5% - 3.0%';
        } else {
            loanApp.Loan_Amount__c = 0;
            loanApp.Interest_Rate__c = 'N/A';
        }
        
        // Provide pre-qualification outcome explanation
        if (loanApp.Loan_Amount__c > 0) {
            loanApp.Pre_Qualification_Outcome__c = 'Congratulations! You are pre-qualified for a loan amount of $' + loanApp.Loan_Amount__c + ' with an interest rate range of ' + loanApp.Interest_Rate__c + '.';
        } else {
            loanApp.Pre_Qualification_Outcome__c = 'Sorry, you do not meet the pre-qualification criteria for a loan.';
        }
    }
}
